Hello! Welcome to my homepage. My name is Saptarshi Chakraborty. I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. I received my PhD in statistics from University of Florida in 2018. My current research focuses on both theoretical and applied aspects of statistics, and my research interests include Bayesian modeling, Markov chain Monte Carlo, modeling and analysis of genetic/genomic data, analysis of big and high-dimensional data, dimension reduction, statistical modeling in computational biology, and applications of statistics in biomedical research. I am also very interested in computational statistics and statistical programming, and have developed multiple statistical software packages (mostly in [R](https://www.r-project.org/)).
