I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. I received my PhD in statistics from University of Florida in 2018. I work on both theory and applications of statistics; my research interests include Bayesian modeling, theoretical and computational aspects of Markov Chain Monte carlo techniques, modeling and analysis of genetic/genomic data, statistical methodologies for big and high-dimensional data, statistical modeling in cellular biology and applications of statistical techniques in biochemical research. I am also very interested in computational statistics, and have developed multiple software packages.
