Hello! Welcome to my homepage. My name is Saptarshi Chakraborty. I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York. I received my PhD in statistics from University of Florida in 2018. I current research focuses on both theoretical and applied aspects of statistics; my research interests include Bayesian modeling, Markov chain Monte Carlo, modeling and analysis of genetic/genomic data, analysis of big and high-dimensional data, dimension reduction, statistical modeling in computational biology, and applications of statistics in biomedical research. I am also very interested in statistical computations, and have developed multiple statistical software packages (mostly) in R.
